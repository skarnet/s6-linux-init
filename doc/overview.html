<h1> An overview of s6-linux-init </h1>

<h2> Organisation of the package </h2>

<p>
 When installed, the <tt>s6-linux-init</tt> package provides the
following:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> <em>Binaries</em>, that are typically installed in <tt>/bin</tt>:
  <ul>
   <li> <a href="s6-linux-init-maker.html">s6-linux-init-maker</a> is the main
program of the package and is used to create <tt>/sbin/init</tt> scripts
and their supporting environment depending on configuration parameters
given on its command line. </li>
   <li> <a href="s6-linux-init-hpr.html">s6-linux-init-hpr</a> is an
implementation of the SysV <tt>halt</tt>, <tt>poweroff</tt> and <tt>reboot</tt>
commands; <a href="s6-linux-init-telinit.html">s6-linux-init-telinit</a>
is an implementation of the SysV <tt>telinit</tt> command; and
 <a href="s6-linux-init-shutdown.html">s6-linux-init-shutdown</a>
is an implementation of the
<a href="http://refspecs.linuxbase.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-PDA/LSB-PDA/shutdown.html">shutdown</a>
command.  <a href="s6-linux-init.html">s6-linux-init</a> is an
implementation of stage 1 <tt>/sbin/init</tt>, but it needs to be
given command-line options in order to do what the user has chosen.
An invocation of <a href="s6-linux-init-maker.html">s6-linux-init-maker</a>
will create proper wrappers for all those commands, named after their
short SysV names; the wrappers are directly usable as turnkey replacements
for SysV commands. </li>
   <li> Other binaries are support binaries, not meant to be called
directly by the user. They are called internally, in scripts
created by a
<a href="s6-linux-init-maker.html">s6-linux-init-maker</a> invocation -
typically in run scripts for early services. </li>
  </ul> </li> <br />

 <li> A <em>small library</em>, that for now contains a single symbol,
<tt>s6_linux_init_logouthook()</tt>, intended for distributions using
<tt>login</tt> programs that add utmp entries for users logging in and
expect <tt>init</tt> to clean up after them when users log out. See
the <a href="s6-linux-init-logouthookd.html">s6-linux-init-logouthookd</a>
page for details. </li> <br />

 <li> <em>Skeleton scripts</em>, installed by default in
<tt>/etc/s6-linux-init/skel</tt>; that location can be changed at build
time via the <tt>--skeldir</tt> configure option. At
<tt>s6-linux-init-maker</tt> invocation time, the scripts are copied from the skeleton
directory to the <tt>scripts</tt> subdirectory of the directory created
by <tt>s6-linux-init-maker</tt>, and the copy is meant to be edited
by the user. The skeleton scripts are commented and examples of
interaction with various service managers are given; it is recommended
to review them, and possibly edit them too.
These scripts are the following:
  <ul>
   <li> <em>rc.init</em>: the script launching the system initialization
procedure once stage 1 init is done and
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-svscan.html">s6-svscan</a> is
safely running as pid 1. </li>
   <li> <em>rc.shutdown</em>: the script launching the system shutdown
procedure when the admin runs a <tt>halt</tt>, <tt>poweroff</tt>,
<tt>reboot</tt> or <tt>shutdown</tt> command. </li>
   <li> <em>runlevel</em>: the script executing a machine state change
at boot time (normally invoked by <em>rc.init</em>, towards the default
runlevel) or when the administrator runs a <tt>telinit</tt> command.
This script is unused in a container. </li>
   <li> <em>rc.shutdown.final</em>: a script that will be run at the
very end of the shutdown procedure, after all processes have been killed
and all filesystems have been unmounted, <em>just before</em> the system
is rebooted or the power turned off. This script normally remains empty. </li>
  </ul> </li>
</ul>

<h2> Organisation of the booted system </h2>

<p>
 When a system has booted on an <tt>/sbin/init</tt> program created by
<a href="s6-linux-init-maker.html">s6-linux-init-maker</a>, the following
invariants are met:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> A tmpfs is mounted on <tt>/run</tt> - that location can be changed
at build-time via the <tt>--tmpfsdir</tt> option to configure. The rest
of this document assumes it is <tt>/run</tt>. </li>
 <li> <a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-svscan.html">s6-svscan</a> is
running as pid 1 on the <tt>/run/service</tt> scandir. </li>
 <li> Every process on the system is running with at least the environment
defined in the <tt>/etc/s6-linux-init/current/env</tt> envdir. The
<tt>/etc/s6-linux-init/current</tt> location can be changed at
<a href="s6-linux-init-maker.html">s6-linux-init-maker</a> invocation time
via the <tt>-c</tt> option. </li>
 <li> Some early services are defined in <tt>/run/service</tt>, and running.
They are not seen by the service manager and should remain up all the time,
until the machine shuts down: they are considered a part of the init system,
even if they're not process 1.
Apart from <tt>s6-linux-init-shutdownd</tt>, which is necessary for the
machine (or container) to respond to shutdown requests, they are only present
depending on the configuration, and different
<a href="s6-linux-init-maker.html">s6-linux-init-maker</a> invocations will
yield different sets of services. The services are picked from this list:
  <ul>
   <li> <tt>s6-linux-init-shutdownd</tt>: the shutdown manager, running
the shutdown sequence in a reproducible environment when a shutdown command
is executed, then performing the last shutdown steps. </li>
   <li> <tt>s6-svscan-log</tt>: the catch-all logger </li>
   <li> <tt>s6-linux-init-runleveld</tt>: the runlevel manager, running
the <em>runlevel</em> script in a reproducible environment when a <tt>telinit</tt>
command is executed. </li>
   <li> <tt>s6-linux-init-logouthookd</tt>: a local service performing
utmp record cleanup duty for patched <tt>login</tt> programs. </li>
   <li> <tt>s6-linux-init-early-getty</tt>: the early getty,
allowing the user to login even if <em>rc.init</em> fails early. </li>
   <li> <tt>utmpd</tt> and <tt>wtmpd</tt>: the services performing
utmp and wtmp access when <a href="//skarnet.org/software/utmps/">utmps</a> is
used. </li>
  </ul> </li>
</ul>

 <h2> Integration with the service manager </h2>

<p>
 The s6-linux-init package's duties stop where the service manager's start.
s6-linux-init simply brings the system up to the point where it is stable and
operational enough for the service manager to take over; and at shutdown
time, s6-linux-init just tells the service manager to bring down the services,
and then performs the last steps of the shutdown: killing all the remaining
processes, unmounting the file systems and halting/powering off/rebooting
the machine.
</p>

<p>
 All the interactions between s6-linux-init and the service manager are
configurable: they happen in the <em>rc.init</em>, <em>rc.shutdown</em>
and <em>runlevel</em> scripts. Examples are provided in the skeleton
scripts, that you should review and edit.
